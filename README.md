Create a Supreme Admin that will be given full permissions. Roles are used to determine an agent's permissions so not all agents will have unlimited access.

Create a System Admins department. This is where the Supreme Admins will be designated. Each Agent is assigned to a specific department depending on their assigned role within the helpdesk. 

<img width="800" alt="9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d565f038-5e4e-4b13-a5ca-86c45407b3e6" />

Diferent departments are there so that tickets are only visible to the right departments (e.g., Help Desk, System Admins, Networking).
