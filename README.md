<img width="572" alt="3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e8afeed-01de-4ddb-8e53-f394d151e7d9" />

Create a Supreme Admin that will be given full permissions. Roles are used to determine an agent's permissions so not all agents will have unlimited access.

<img width="800" alt="7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a09d5333-4bb8-4046-b3e3-8adf8716665a" />

<img width="700" alt="8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a09026e7-3194-46c4-87e7-8f3673799e75" />

Create a System Admins department. This is where the Supreme Admins will be designated. Each Agent is assigned to a specific department depending on their assigned role within the helpdesk. 

<img width="800" alt="9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d565f038-5e4e-4b13-a5ca-86c45407b3e6" />

Diferent departments are there so that tickets are only visible to the right departments (e.g., Help Desk, System Admins, Networking).

<img width="800" alt="10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa3b70cd-6e17-49b5-8805-9c9a5709b325" />

Create an Online Banking Team. Teams allow collaboration between agents from different departments who will work together on specific types of issues.

<h3> 4Ô∏è‚É£ Modify User Registration Settings </h3>

<h3> 5Ô∏è‚É£ Add Agents </h3>

Agents are the employees of the helpdesk that actually work on solving tickets. They are assigned primary departments and given a primary role for tickets sent to their department. They can be given access to other departments other than their own and can also have different roles depending on which department they are in.

Admin Panel -> Agents -> Add New Agent

<img width="800" alt="15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b5d2709-a7c3-44bd-ae19-a00e91bc9f74" />
